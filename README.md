# Code-Problems
A place to put solutions to the various code problems I am going to work through.

Problem 1. Create a script that can tell whether on not a sequence of nine numbers is a magic square. A magic square is a 3 X 3 grid of numbers that when added together by row, column, or in two diagonal directions, equals the same sum.
BONUS: Make a Program that discovers all single digit 3X3 magic squares.

Problem 2. Create a Password generator that will create a random password. The only user input is the length in letters of the password. The password needs to contain a capital letter, a number, and a symbol.
BONUS: Create a password generator based on this xkcd comic (https://xkcd.com/936/)
